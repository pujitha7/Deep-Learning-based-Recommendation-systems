# Deep-Learning-based-Recommendation-systems

Recommendation systems play an extremely important role in e-commerce, by recommending products that suit the taste of the consumers, e-commerce companies can generate large profits.

Majority of Recommendation systems relies on algorithms that are designed under the assumption that user preferences are static patterns. These algorithms do not take into consideration an important factor time. But generating recommendations is inherently time dependent.

Recurrent Neural Networks represents a class of Deep Learning models which possess several properties which make them useful for sequence modelling. Thus these RNNs can be used for history-based recommendation system.

# Problem Description

Given a sequence of user purchased products we use Recurrent Neural Network variants to predict the next item user is most likely to buy.
